# Stadium Visit Tracker
The stadium visit tracker is a single page applicationg designed to help log stadium visits. 

## Project Overview

I created this project based on two things that I enjoy to do.  Travel and watch football.  It's always been a goal to travel and attend as many football games as I can.  Think of it like a bucket list.  For those who want to visit every stadium.  

This project is designed for people who want to tavel and watch football.  As a means to keep track of stadiums visited and stadiums still left to visit, this app makes it easier to keep that running list. 

## Features
- Can view through all of the NFL stadiums and locations of stadiums 
- Can mark dates visited as well as comment on experience of your visit
